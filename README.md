# mosaic-fun
Fun with crazy mosaic. It has a random worm goes around and adds 
red component to the buttons.
When the red component on some button reaches 255 then it stops. 
Also value of each component is written on the button.

The size of the window can be resized.

Also there is a .jar application that is already compiled
and can be run directly.
